# Hard Mode

## Description of Program
This is a currency converter application that will convert currencies, add them, subtract them, and multiply them.


## Description of Hard Mode Solution
I solved hard mode in two different ways. If the currency that it was converting from was USD, I had a couple of common conversion rates listed.
If it was not USD, I asked the user to enter the conversion rate and then did the calculation. Since there are so many different currencies it didn't seem feasible to list them all within the program
